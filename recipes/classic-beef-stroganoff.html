    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic Russian dish is known for its tender slices of beef in a rich, sour cream sauce, 
        traditionally served over egg noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Beef:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs sirloin steak or beef tenderloin, sliced thinly against the grain</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>12 oz cremini (baby bella) mushrooms, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine or an additional 1/4 cup beef broth (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz wide egg noodles</li>
        <li>Salt for pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Prepare the beef:</em> Season the sliced beef generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><em>Cook the beef:</em> Heat the olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium-high 
            heat. Add the beef in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan, and sear quickly until 
            browned on both sides (about 1-2 minutes per side). Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><em>Sauté aromatics:</em> Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 2 tbsp of butter to the skillet. 
                Add the sliced onions and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li><em>Cook mushrooms:</em> Add the sliced mushrooms to the pan. Cook until the mushrooms have released 
            their moisture and are nicely browned, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><em>Deglaze (optional):</em> If using, pour in the white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned 
            bits from the bottom. Let the wine reduce by half.</li>
        <li><em>Make the roux:</em> Sprinkle the flour over the onions and mushrooms and stir constantly for 1 minute to 
            cook the raw flour taste out.</li>
        <li><em>Add broth:</em> Gradually whisk in the beef broth and Dijon mustard. Bring the mixture to a simmer, 
            whisking until the gravy thickens.</li>
        <li><em>Cook noodles:</em> While the sauce simmers and thickens, cook the egg noodles according to package directions 
            in salted water. Drain them when finished.</li>
        <li><em>Combine and finish:</em> Turn the heat down to low. Stir in the room-temperature sour cream until fully incorporated. 
            Return the cooked beef (and any accumulated juices) to the skillet and stir gently to combine. Heat the mixture 
            through for 1-2 minutes, but do not let it boil after adding the sour cream, as it may curdle.</li>
        <li><em>Serve:</em> Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Garnish with fresh parsley and 
            serve immediately over the hot egg noodles.</li>
    </ol>
