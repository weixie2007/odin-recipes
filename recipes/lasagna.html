    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is a classic, highly-rated recipe for traditional meat lasagna 
        that uses a rich meat sauce and a creamy ricotta cheese mixture. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the meat sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 lb Italian sausage (casings removed)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>24 oz (3 cups) marinara sauce (such as Rao's or a preferred brand)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry red wine or beef broth (optional, for depth of flavor)</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Cheese Mixture:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated and divided</li>
        <li>2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Assembly:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles (regular noodles, not no-boil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the meat sause</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef, Italian sausage, and diced onion.</li>
                <li>Sauté for about 5 to 7 minutes until the meat is browned and the onions are translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. If using, stir in the red wine and cook until it has nearly evaporated.</li>
                <li>Stir in the marinara sauce, dried basil, thyme, salt, 
                    and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then cover and cook for at least 5 minutes to allow the flavors to combine.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Cook the Noodles</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until 
                    al dente (firm to the bite) according to package directions. Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water to prevent sticking. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten egg, 1.5 cups of the mozzarella cheese, 
                    1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and salt. Mix well. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Spread about 1 cup of the meat sauce across the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Arrange 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly if needed.</li>
                <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, then top with 
                    approximately 1.5 cups of the meat sauce. Sprinkle with some of the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers two more times.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Bake and Serve</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Top the final layer of noodles and sauce with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil (spraying the underside with cooking spray can prevent sticking) and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows it to set and prevents it from falling apart. </li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
