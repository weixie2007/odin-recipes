    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe provides a classic approach to making Swedish meatballs, 
        known for their tender texture and rich, creamy gravy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Meatballs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20 is ideal)</li>
        <li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely crushed plain breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream or whole milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 small onion, very finely minced or grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground allspice</li>
        <li>Pinch of ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter (for frying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Gravy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth (warm is best)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Prepare the meat mixture:</em> In a large bowl, soak the breadcrumbs in the heavy cream or 
            milk for a few minutes until soft.</li>
        <li><em>Combine ingredients:</em> Add the ground beef, ground pork, beaten egg, minced onion, salt, pepper, 
            allspice, and nutmeg to the softened breadcrumb mixture.</li>
        <li><em>Mix gently:</em> Use your hands to gently mix the ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, 
            or the meatballs will become tough.</li>
        <li><em>Form the meatballs:</em> Roll the mixture into small, bite-sized balls (about 1 inch in diameter).</li>
        <li><em>Cook the meatballs:</em> Heat 2 tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Carefully add the meatballs 
            in batches (do not overcrowd the pan) and brown them on all sides. Once browned, remove them from the 
            skillet and set them aside on a plate. They do not need to be fully cooked through at this stage.</li>
        <li><em>Make the roux:</em> In the same skillet (keep the leftover drippings), reduce the heat to medium-low. 
            Add the remaining 3 tbsp of butter and let it melt. Whisk in the 3 tbsp of flour and cook for 
            about 1-2 minutes, constantly whisking, until the roux turns a light golden color.</li>
        <li><em>Whisk in liquid:</em> Gradually pour in the warm beef broth while whisking continuously to prevent lumps. 
            Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li><em>Finish the gravy:</em> Once the gravy has thickened slightly, whisk in the heavy cream, Worcestershire sauce, 
            and Dijon mustard. Let it simmer gently for 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><em>Combine and serve:</em> Return the browned meatballs to the skillet with the gravy. Simmer for another 
            5-10 minutes, or until the meatballs are fully cooked through and heated. Serve immediately over egg noodles, 
            mashed potatoes, or with lingonberry</li>
    </ol>
